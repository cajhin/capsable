# capsable
hardcoded kingcon layout on LInux 

Prototype, using the Linux version of Interception 
https://gitlab.com/interception

Aiming to enable my personal minimum must-have keyboard config.
For me, this is a prerequisite to use bare metal Linux installations.

Long term it would be nice if it could parse and implement capsicain ini files.
Probably lots of effort and cross-platform trouble.

Missing: special chars for coding, with Alt+[x]
